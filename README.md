# MobileApp

Collective writing
The app contains a list of writings (novels) in progress. Each novel has an owner (the user who started writing it). Other users can submit possible continuations (let's say, a chapter) to the novel. Then, the owner can look at the list of chapter proposals and select the one he likes the most to append it to his story. He can also edit a chapter proposal before appending it to the story.

Every user can read the existing novel.
Only an authenitcated user can start a new novel or submit a proposal for a chapter.

When an owner appends the chapter to his novel, the writer of it receives an e-mail.
