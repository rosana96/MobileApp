# MobileApp

App story:
The app will contain a list of bible books, each bible book contains more chapters, each chapter contains more verses.
Users can select what book/chapter they want to read.

Authenticated users can add comments about a chapter or a verse and they can quote a verse on their "news feed". They can also see what other users commented on that chapter/verse and they can see who quoted a verse in their "news feed" in the previous month.

-- maybe something like replying to comments and having the possibility to send an e-mail in order to contact another user?
